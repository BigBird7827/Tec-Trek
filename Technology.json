      "SidebarText": "Propulsion is the ship’s full movement stack: warp for FTL, impulse for sublight, and thrusters for fine maneuvering, all coordinated with inertial management so the crew and structure can tolerate acceleration and rapid course changes. propulsion performance is often limited by power availability, field stability, and system damage, with crews rerouting power or compensating for imbalances to keep the ship mobile.\n\nDifferent mission profiles emphasize different modes—cruise, pursuit, evasion, station-keeping—but the common theme is that speed and maneuverability come from integration: engines, control systems, and shipwide power distribution working as one."

      "SidebarText": "Cloaking technology generates a ship-scale field that redirects light and many sensor energies around the hull, reducing visibility to both the eye and standard scans. Its tactical value is control: a cloaked vessel can approach, reposition, or disengage without presenting a reliable target solution.\n\nCloaking is a constrained operating mode. It draws significant power, is tightly coupled to ship systems, and often forces brief tactical exposure at key moments. Countermeasures evolve alongside it, with tachyon-based scans and multi-ship detection grids used to reveal cloaked ships under the right conditions."

      "ID": "st-impulse-drive",
      "Name": "Impulse drive",
      "SystemID": "propulsion",
      "Type": "System",
      "Summary": "Impulse drive is the standard sublight propulsion mode used by starships for routine travel within a star system, close‑range navigation, docking approaches, formation flight, and tactical maneuvering. In practice, it’s the ship’s everyday “under normal space” engine: the setting you hear most often on the bridge—one‑quarter impulse, half impulse, or full impulse—when warp is unnecessary, unsafe, or simply the wrong tool.\n\nOn screen, impulse is consistently framed as a power‑regulated propulsion system integrated into the ship’s overall energy management. Captains call for changes in *impulse power* as readily as they call for shields or phasers, and engineering treats impulse as something that can be surged, rerouted, repaired, shut down, or pushed beyond safe limits in emergencies.",
      "Sections": {
        "What impulse drive is": "Impulse drive (often referred to as the ship’s impulse engines) provides sustained sublight thrust. It is used whenever a ship needs precise, controllable acceleration without engaging warp—leaving drydock, maneuvering in orbit, holding station, closing to transport range, or fighting at close quarters.\n\nImpulse is also an operational concept: bridge orders like “impulse power at your discretion,” “reduce impulse power,” or “full impulse” are treated as standardized shorthand for how hard the ship should push its sublight engines under current conditions.",
        "Impulse power and shipwide energy management": "Impulse is presented as a major consumer of a ship’s power budget. Dialogue frequently treats impulse output as something that can be raised, lowered, restored, or lost—sometimes independently of other systems. When a ship is damaged, crews may fight to get *impulse power* back online, reroute conduits, or manually restore the engine feed so the ship can maneuver or escape.\n\nThat framing matters for your database: impulse isn’t just “go fast.” In many stories, it’s the difference between being able to change position, hold orbit, break a tractor lock, or avoid impact—especially when warp is unavailable.",
        "Command language and operating modes": "Impulse is commonly expressed as a fraction of maximum (“one‑quarter impulse,” “half impulse,” “full impulse”). The shows don’t lock this to a single universal velocity; instead, it behaves like a bridge‑level throttle setting that accounts for ship class, mass, power availability, and safety constraints.\n\nTwo related concepts show up repeatedly:\n• **Reverse impulse** — the ship applies impulse thrust in reverse for braking, backing off, or holding position.\n• **Impulse at discretion** — the pilot or helmsman selects a safe output appropriate to the situation without needing a specific number.",
        "Use cases across the franchise": "Impulse drive dominates day‑to‑day operations. It’s the mode for in‑system travel and close‑range work: leaving spacedock, approaching a planet, rendezvousing with another vessel, or executing delicate maneuvers where warp fields would be hazardous.\n\nIt also shows up in “time pressure” situations: ships run at impulse inside systems to intercept threats or reach a destination quickly while still obeying whatever limits apply to warp travel in that environment.",
        "Tactical significance": "Most starship engagements are depicted at sublight scales: ships circle, exchange fire, line up torpedo shots, and reposition to protect a damaged area of shields. In that context, impulse performance is effectively the ship’s tactical mobility—how quickly it can bring weapons to bear, evade an attack run, or hold a defensive formation.\n\nDamage to impulse is therefore a serious tactical blow. When impulse drops offline, a ship can become a drifting target, unable to maintain distance or change heading effectively.",
        "Failure modes, stress, and emergency behavior": "Impulse engines are often portrayed as temperamental under damage or extreme demand: they can surge, cut out, overheat, or require emergency handling. Stories treat “pushing impulse” as something that can be risky—either because the engines are already compromised or because the ship is operating at the edge of what its structure and systems can safely support.\n\nIn the most extreme cases, impulse operation is linked to catastrophic outcomes: a damaged ship may risk blowing its impulse engines, or an engineering team may attempt to overload the system as part of a desperate plan.",
        "Visual identity and ship design cues": "Impulse drive is frequently represented visually by paired impulse engine ports or grilles on the aft portion of a ship’s main hull. These are distinct from warp nacelles and are treated as the visible “sublight engines.”\n\nEven when the exact geometry varies by era and class, the storytelling function is consistent: the impulse assembly signals sublight thrust and provides a recognizable cue for whether the ship is maneuvering under impulse rather than at warp.",
        "Relationship to warp, thrusters, and inertial control": "Impulse sits in a family of ship handling systems. Thrusters handle fine translation and attitude changes; impulse provides sustained thrust for travel and combat maneuvers; warp handles interstellar transit. In practice, these systems interlock—particularly with inertial management—because the ship must remain habitable and controllable under acceleration.\n\nThis is why impulse is repeatedly treated as more than a toggle: it’s a major operational mode that affects navigation, tactics, and the ship’s ability to function when other propulsion options are restricted."

      "Name": "Thrusters",
      "SystemID": "propulsion",
      "Type": "Subsystem",
      "Summary": "Thrusters are the ship’s low‑power reaction control devices: small engine outlets distributed around the hull that provide precise attitude and translation control. They’re used when impulse is too blunt or too risky—docking, station‑keeping, slow backing maneuvers, close formation work, and careful alignment in tight spaces.\n\nStar Trek treats thrusters as a separate layer of propulsion that sits underneath impulse and warp. They don’t make a ship “fast” on their own, but they make it controllable—especially at low velocity, in confined areas, or when the main engines are unavailable.",
      "Sections": {
        "What thrusters do": "Thrusters (often referred to as maneuvering thrusters, maneuvering jets, or reaction control thrusters) provide fine control over a ship’s motion: tiny changes in heading, gentle translational movement, controlled rotation about an axis, and the ability to hold position relative to another object.\n\nThey’re most often invoked when a ship needs to move carefully—leaving spacedock, lining up with a docking port, holding station near a platform or debris field, or creeping away from danger without the shove of impulse.",
        "Reaction control and station‑keeping": "The franchise frequently frames thrusters as the tool for station‑keeping—maintaining a fixed position relative to another object by continuously making small corrections. This is the practical difference between thrusters and impulse: impulse is great for sustained travel and larger acceleration, but station‑keeping is about micro‑maneuvers repeated constantly.\n\nThrusters also provide the slow, deliberate motion you see during docking, undocking, and careful alignment maneuvers, where even small errors can be dangerous.",
        "Maneuvering thrusters vs. acceleration thrusters": "On screen and in technical labeling, thrusters show up in more than one role. The most common are maneuvering thrusters—built for control, not speed. Some references also distinguish acceleration thrusters, which can add speed but still live below impulse in both power and purpose.\n\nFor Tec‑Trek, it’s useful to treat Thrusters as the umbrella entry, with maneuvering thrusters as the primary subtype you’ll actually see in day‑to‑day ship handling.",
        "How crews interact with them": "Thrusters are usually run through flight control systems, but the franchise also acknowledges manual thruster control—where a control mode or panel can be used to command thrusters directly. That matters for storytelling: if main power is compromised, if automation is unreliable, or if the ship needs an unusually delicate or deliberate move, thruster control becomes a named action.\n\nThruster control is also treated as something that can be lost when power fails—reinforcing that thrusters are part of the ship’s broader power and control infrastructure.",
        "Failure modes and why they matter": "Because thrusters are the precision layer, losing them often turns a manageable situation into a crisis. When a ship can’t back off slowly, can’t rotate away from danger, or can’t hold a stable attitude, even having impulse available may not solve the immediate problem—especially in a confined environment or near a hazard.\n\nStories use thruster failures to raise the stakes in slow-motion scenarios: creeping too close to an object, losing control during delicate docking, or being unable to maintain safe alignment.",
        "Where they fit in the propulsion stack": "A useful way to think about propulsion in Star Trek is as a stack of operating layers:\n\n• Thrusters: precision control and low‑velocity motion (attitude, translation, station‑keeping)\n• Impulse: standard sublight travel and combat maneuvering at scale\n• Warp: field‑based interstellar travel\n\nThrusters therefore belong in Propulsion even though they aren’t the main engines. They’re the ship’s fine-handling muscles—the part you miss immediately when it’s gone."

Rather than treating speed as simple acceleration through normal space, warp travel is framed as controlled field generation: a ship produces a shaped warp field—often described as a subspace bubble—that allows sustained superluminal transit between stars.\n\nBecause warp is an operating mode rather than a single component, a complete “warp drive” entry naturally spans the ship’s power reactor (the warp core and its matter/antimatter reaction system), distribution hardware (plasma/EPS pathways), and the field projectors (warp coils in the nacelles) that form and stabilize the warp field.",
      "Sections": {
        "What warp drive is": "Warp drive (sometimes called a warp engine) enables faster‑than‑light travel by generating warp fields around a vessel. The field is described as a subspace‑related effect that envelops the ship, allowing interstellar distances to be crossed in practical time. On the bridge, warp performance is communicated using warp factors (“warp six,” “warp 9.2”), which function as an operational shorthand for the field settings required to achieve a given effective velocity.\n\nAcross eras, the franchise keeps the same recognizable idea—warp fields, warp factors, nacelles, and a warp core—while letting specific details vary by ship class and period.",
        "Warp field and the subspace bubble": "On-screen dialogue repeatedly treats the warp field as a shaped structure that must remain stable: crews diagnose field asymmetry, harmonics, and other stability problems rather than simply “losing speed.” The common implication is that the ship is riding inside a controlled field configuration (often called a warp bubble or subspace bubble) that permits superluminal transit.\n\nThis framing is useful for storytelling because it makes warp travel adjustable and fallible. A ship can be forced out of warp by field instability, interference, or damage to the hardware that generates and regulates the field—without requiring that the entire ship be physically destroyed.",
        "The warp core and the matter/antimatter reaction": "Federation starships are most often portrayed as powering warp operations with a controlled matter/antimatter reaction in the warp core’s reaction assembly. Matter and antimatter are injected into a central reaction region in a regulated intermix ratio, releasing enormous energy. Dilithium is consistently referenced as a key element in moderating and regulating that reaction so energy can be safely drawn for ship systems.\n\nThe warp core is therefore both propulsion-critical and ship-critical: it’s treated as the heart of the vessel’s energy budget, with stability, containment, and shutdown procedures forming a constant part of engineering life.",
        "Nacelles, warp coils, and field generation": "While the core produces the power and reaction control, the ship’s warp nacelles are repeatedly framed as the field‑generation hardware. Warp coils (field coils) housed in the nacelles are fed by the core’s output—commonly described as plasma routed through conduits—and then used to project and shape the warp field.\n\nThis is why nacelles are treated as essential systems: damage to a nacelle, coil assembly, or the plasma feed can produce immediate warp‑field problems even if the core remains intact.",
        "Warp factors and performance": "Warp speed is expressed as a warp factor. Warp one marks the light‑speed threshold for warp travel, and higher factors represent increasingly greater effective velocities. The franchise is not perfectly consistent about mapping warp factor to a single numeric “times light speed” value, but it is consistently portrayed as non‑linear—small changes near the top end are treated as major jumps in performance and stress.\n\nIn practical terms, warp factor is the language the crew uses to communicate intent (“make best speed,” “maximum warp,” “warp nine”) while the computer and engineering systems handle the underlying field geometry, power routing, and safety margins.",
        "Operations, safeties, and failure modes": "Warp operation is depicted as a balance between power, stability, and structural limits. Common operational themes include rerouting power, balancing flow between nacelles, tuning field harmonics, isolating damaged conduits, and executing emergency shutdowns.\n\nCommonly referenced failure risks include containment loss or a core breach, field collapse due to coil damage or imbalance, and cascading power tradeoffs where maintaining warp conflicts with shields, weapons, or critical life support. These risks keep warp drive grounded as an engineered system with real procedures rather than a purely magical travel button.",
        "Environmental impact and speed limits": "A notable 24th‑century concern raised on screen is cumulative subspace damage linked to sustained high‑warp travel in certain regions. In response, Starfleet institutes a warp speed restriction (a “speed limit”) with emergency exceptions, emphasizing that warp operation can have systemic consequences beyond an individual ship’s maintenance.\n\nLater stories treat the restriction as temporary or unevenly applied, but the episode establishes an enduring idea: warp drive is powerful enough to create environmental side effects under the right conditions.",
        "History and development": "Human warp history is anchored by Zefram Cochrane’s first successful warp flight, which becomes a turning point leading directly to first contact with the Vulcans. From there, Starfleet warp systems advance from early, more limited reactors to the mature 23rd‑ and 24th‑century architectures built around high‑output warp cores, nacelle coil systems, and increasingly refined control and safety layers.\n\nDifferent cultures field different design approaches—some emphasizing stealth, speed, or alternative superluminal methods—so “warp drive” also sits inside a larger family of faster‑than‑light technologies that include transwarp concepts and other specialized propulsion modes."

On ships, phasers are valued for precision, rapid re‑targeting, and controllable output—ranging from warning shots and disabling strikes to sustained fire for hull damage.\n\nPhaser technology grew out of earlier phase‑modulated particle weapons; by later centuries, phaser arrays and banks became the default ship‑to‑ship energy armament.",
      "Sections": {
        "What a starship phaser is": "A starship phaser is a ship‑mounted directed‑energy emitter that can deliver focused energy on target as a beam or pulse, depending on the installation and era. Ships commonly distribute emitters across the hull to widen firing arcs and reduce blind spots.\n\nCompared with torpedoes, phasers are the ‘immediate response’ weapon: they’re fast, can be walked across a target, and can be used repeatedly without loading a new round.",
        "Phaser arrays, banks, and cannons": "Star Trek uses several labels for ship phasers. Phaser banks are grouped emitter installations common in earlier eras, while phaser arrays are long, distributed emitter strips that can fire along their length to provide broad coverage. Some ships mount phaser cannons—heavier forward‑firing systems optimized for punch rather than coverage.\n\nFor the database, it’s useful to treat these as variants under one core technology entry, because they share the same basic role: ship‑to‑ship directed‑energy fire.",
        "Output control and tactical use": "Phasers are routinely portrayed as adjustable in effect and intensity. That flexibility supports ‘damage for purpose’: disabling a subsystem, cutting into a specific area of the hull, or applying sustained pressure against shields.\n\nPhasers are also used as utility tools in some scenarios—cutting, heating, or controlled ablation—though shipboard use is most often framed through tactical fire and target selection.",
        "Power, firing limits, and heat": "Ship phasers draw from the vessel’s power systems through tactical distribution. Because they can fire repeatedly, the limiting factor tends to be power availability, heat management, and the ship’s ability to keep emitters and control hardware within safe operating limits.\n\nIn story terms, this is why battles often include lines about diverting power to phasers, taking emitters offline, or losing phaser control after system damage.",
        "Relationship to earlier phase technology": "Phaser technology is described as being preceded by phase‑modulated particle weapons used in the mid‑22nd century, including ship‑mounted phase cannons. That lineage matters for Tec‑Trek because it ties NX‑era armaments to later Federation standards: phase cannons are a recognizable ancestor rather than an unrelated one‑off."

      "Summary": "Photon torpedoes are warp‑capable tactical matter/antimatter weapons commonly deployed on starships and starbases. They serve as the standard heavy projectile complement to phasers: slower than beams, but capable of delivering concentrated explosive force.\n\nThey debut on-screen in TOS and remain a franchise workhorse across eras, with frequent mission‑specific modifications (yield tuning, special payloads, sensor packages, and guidance profiles).",
      "Sections": {
        "What makes a photon torpedo different": "Photon torpedoes are physical projectiles with an energetic warhead. Unlike phasers, they deliver damage through a detonation rather than continuous energy application. They’re used when a single strike matters—breaking a target, forcing shields, or delivering a specialized payload.\n\nTorpedoes are also routinely shown as configurable before launch, which is why crews talk about arming, setting yields, and loading special warheads.",
        "Warp capability and pursuit": "A key trait often emphasized is that photon torpedoes can be warp‑capable, allowing engagement across larger tactical envelopes than purely sublight munitions. This supports the classic Star Trek ‘chase and fire’ rhythm—torpedoes remain relevant even when ships are maneuvering fast.",
        "Launchers, tubes, and firing arcs": "Ships mount torpedo launchers (often forward and aft) that define arcs of fire. Some designs integrate other functions into the launcher structure, and the launcher itself becomes a tactical focal point—damaged tubes, jammed doors, or destroyed launchers change what a ship can do in a fight.\n\nFor Tec‑Trek, the launcher hardware is part of the weapons ecosystem, but the torpedo entry focuses on the munition and how it’s used.",
        "Modification culture": "Photon torpedoes are among the franchise’s most frequently modified tools: tracking modifications, alternate warheads, and mission‑specific payloads show up repeatedly. That flexibility is part of why they remain in service even as newer torpedo types arrive.",
        "Relationship to earlier torpedoes": "In the 22nd century, Earth Starfleet relied on spatial torpedoes and later upgraded to photonic torpedoes, which are described as precursors to photon torpedoes. That makes the ‘photon’ family a through‑line from NX‑era development to later standard fleet armament."

      "Summary": "Quantum torpedoes are an advanced torpedo type used as a high-yield complement or successor to photons on certain late‑24th/25th‑century platforms. They’re framed as premium ordnance—more expensive, but worth it when you need a heavier punch.\n\nOn-screen, they appear as a recognizable ‘next step’ in Federation torpedo development, with a distinct visual language and recurring tactical reputation.",
      "Sections": {
        "What they are": "Quantum torpedoes are presented as a distinct class of tactical torpedo, used alongside or in place of photons. They use casings similar to photon-family torpedoes, but are differentiated by warhead type and performance.",
        "Warhead and performance framing": "Dialogue and technical references treat quantum torpedoes as higher-end ordnance—deployed when the target or situation demands more than standard photons. They’re often associated with newer ships and high-threat missions.",
        "Deployment and platforms": "Quantum torpedoes show up as part of the armament for specific Federation ships and installations during the late 24th century, with the Defiant frequently associated with their introduction. That context matters for Tec‑Trek: quantum torpedoes don’t replace photons everywhere; they’re a selective upgrade.",
        "Operational similarities to photons": "Despite the differences, quantum torpedoes are still torpedoes: finite ammunition, launch tubes, arming sequences, yield considerations, and guidance/lock issues. From a UI standpoint, you can reuse many of the same supporting concepts (launcher hardware, loading, arming, and countermeasures) while keeping the entry focused on what makes them distinct."

      "Summary": "Spatial torpedoes are 22nd‑century torpedo weapons carried aboard early Starfleet ships, including Enterprise NX‑01. Before NX‑era upgrades (phase cannons and later photonic torpedoes), spatial torpedoes were the most powerful weapons in the standard NX inventory.\n\nThey’re depicted as slower, shorter‑ranged, and less effective against deflector shields than later torpedo families—important context for why NX ships lean hard on careful tactics.",
      "Sections": {
        "How they behave": "Spatial torpedoes are portrayed more like early guided missiles than the later ‘energy-bright’ torpedo family: sublight launch, slower approach, and a higher chance of being intercepted or deflected. Against shields they can sometimes bounce and detonate without delivering decisive damage.",
        "Range, speed, and shield interaction": "Technical descriptions highlight a much shorter effective range compared with later photonic torpedoes, and show that point-defense fire can sometimes destroy them before impact. These weaknesses shape early NX-era combat scenes: closing distance is risky, and misses are expensive.",
        "Loading and handling": "Spatial torpedoes are shown as stored and handled as physical rounds, with loading involving manual steps—pulling a torpedo from storage racks and feeding it to a launching rail and tube. This reinforces that NX‑era weapons are closer to ‘early space navy’ hardware than later century automation.",
        "NX‑01 layout": "Enterprise NX‑01 is described as being able to launch spatial torpedoes from multiple points on the ship, including forward and aft tubes. Even after NX‑01 receives newer torpedoes, it keeps its spatial torpedo complement, which makes them a persistent part of NX operational capability."

      "Type": "Device",
      "Summary": "Holographic projectors (also called holo‑emitters or holoprojectors) are the hardware that generates holograms by manipulating photons and force fields. In Federation practice they scale from small tabletop and integrated desktop units to room‑scale installations like holodecks and the fixed emitters used for the Emergency Medical Hologram. On ships with extensive emitter coverage, projectors can sustain photonic characters outside dedicated rooms, but doing so is treated as a significant demand on power and computer resources.",
      "Sections": {
        "What a holographic projector is": "A holographic projector is the emitting and control hardware that produces a three‑dimensional hologram: it projects photons to create the visible image while shaping force fields to provide structure and interaction.",
        "Fixed installations: holodecks and hologrids": "On starships, the best‑known projector installations are holodecks—rooms built around a hologrid of omnidirectional holographic diodes. The grid provides dense emitter coverage so the computer can place holographic objects and characters anywhere within the volume while tracking the user’s position and maintaining the illusion of an expansive environment.",
        "Medical and command use: shipboard holograms": "Projectors are also installed for operational holograms. Voyager’s sickbay projectors support the EMH, and later designs extend emitter coverage beyond a single compartment—most notably the Prometheus, which is depicted as having emitters on every deck so its EMH can move freely throughout the ship.",
        "Portable and integrated projectors": "Holographic projectors are not limited to dedicated rooms. They are shown as compact desktop and tabletop devices capable of producing small, localized projections, and as portable units used for presentation, simulation, or specialized tasks.",
        "Shipwide coverage and resource cost": "Expanding projector coverage turns more of a ship into a potential holodeck volume. Stories consistently treat that as expensive: running large simulations or enabling shipwide projections competes with other major loads and can be a strategic constraint during crises.",
        "Interoperability and program portability": "Across the franchise, holograms are often portrayed as portable in principle—programs created on one platform can be made to run on another if the receiving system can reproduce the necessary photon/force‑field model and control interfaces.",
        "Failure modes and countermeasures": "Because projectors are physical emitters tied into ship power and computing, holograms can fail or degrade when emitters are damaged, when power is interrupted, or when environmental interference disrupts field control. Operational responses include relocating a hologram to a supported volume, rerouting power to emitters, or reducing projection complexity."

On holodecks this allows users to sit, lift, and manipulate holographic props as if they were real; for operational holograms like the EMH it enables tool use, physical interaction, and believable presence. These fields are tightly governed by safety limits and by the boundaries of emitter coverage—when the underlying force-field control fails or is restricted, the hologram’s physicality can degrade or disappear.",

        "Holodeck interaction and safety": "Holodeck props feel solid because the system uses force fields to simulate texture and resistance. The same mechanism can be made dangerous if safety limits are disabled—stories treat force-field intensity as the difference between a safe recreation and a lethal environment.",

      "Name": "Mobile emitter",
      "SystemID": "holography",
      "Type": "Device",
      "Summary": "The mobile emitter is an autonomous, self‑sustaining holo‑emitter designed to power and project a single holographic instance away from permanent photoemitters. Introduced in Voyager’s time‑travel story, it allows the ship’s EMH to operate ‘in the field’—on away missions and throughout the ship—without being confined to sickbay or a holodeck. The device is portrayed as far beyond 24th‑century manufacturing, making it difficult or impossible to reproduce with contemporary Starfleet technology even after years of use.",
      "Sections": {
        "Purpose: mobility beyond permanent emitters": "Most shipboard holograms are tied to fixed emitter networks in sickbay or holodecks. The mobile emitter breaks that constraint by carrying its own projection and field hardware, allowing a hologram to remain active wherever the wearer goes.",
        "Origins and acquisition": "Voyager encounters the emitter as part of 29th‑century technology connected to the timeship Aeon and Henry Starling’s exploitation of future devices in 1996. Starling uses the emitter to control the Doctor’s freedom by threatening to destroy it, since the device is integral to sustaining the displaced hologram.",
        "Physical form and materials": "The 29th‑century emitter is depicted as roughly palm‑sized and constructed of a poly‑deutonic alloy unknown to 24th‑century science. It can be slipped on and off relatively easily for use as needed.",
        "How it sustains a hologram": "The mobile emitter is portrayed as wholly self‑contained, generating the photons and force fields required for a hologram to appear and to physically interact with the environment. The emitter may remain visible as an external device or be concealed by the hologram’s projected form.",
        "Compatibility and reverse-engineering limits": "Voyager retains the emitter despite its anachronistic nature, but dialogue and later references treat recreating it as beyond 2370s capabilities. The issue is not just fabrication—it is also a question of temporal law and whether reverse‑engineering 29th‑century technology would violate the Temporal Prime Directive.",
        "Operational and security implications": "A mobile emitter makes a hologram a true mobile crew asset, but it also concentrates capability into a single, portable point of failure. If the device is damaged, stolen, or forcibly removed, the hologram can be effectively neutralized or taken hostage.",
        "Later availability": "Later-era stories depict mobile emitters as becoming available to Starfleet in the early 25th century, implying the technology eventually enters mainstream Federation use—though it is still treated as specialized equipment rather than ubiquitous ship hardware."

      "SystemID": "cloaking",
      "Type": "Device",
      "Summary": "Shipboard hardware that generates a cloaking field around a vessel, reducing detectability by redirecting light and other energy around the hull. It is introduced as a decisive Romulan advantage—allowing approach, maneuver, and engagement timing to be controlled while the ship remains difficult to locate.\n\nAcross later stories, cloaking is portrayed as an operating mode with constraints and countermeasures: cloaked ships often expose themselves to take actions that require a stable target solution, and Starfleet develops tachyon‑based techniques (including detection grids) to reveal cloaked vessels.",
      "Sections": {
        "What it is": "A Romulan cloaking device is presented as shipboard equipment that creates a cloaking field (early dialogue may frame it as an “invisibility” system). The field redirects light and other energy around the vessel so it appears absent to the eye and is difficult for standard sensors to lock onto.",
        "On-screen behavior": "Romulan ships routinely use cloak tactically to control range and timing: they approach unseen, maneuver for advantage, and choose when to reveal themselves for a strike or scan.\n\nEven in early appearances, the Enterprise may detect motion or other indirect signatures despite the ship not being visually present, reinforcing that “invisible” does not mean “undetectable under every circumstance.”",
        "Operational tradeoffs": "Cloaking is consistently portrayed as power-hungry and tightly coupled to other ship systems. Many stories stage engagements as a cycle of cloak for movement and positioning, then decloak to take action that requires full system access.\n\nFor Tec‑Trek purposes, the recurring takeaway is that a cloak is an operational mode with constraints and procedures—one that shapes tactics as much as it provides concealment.",
        "Counter-detection": "Starfleet’s best-known countermeasure is the tachyon detection grid: multiple ships project tachyon beams to form a field that can reveal a cloaked vessel passing through. Tachyon scans and sweeps are also used in other depictions as a focused attempt to detect cloak-related signatures.",
        "Federation policy context": "In the 24th century, Federation policy is explicitly constrained by the Treaty of Algeron, which prohibits Starfleet from developing or using cloaking devices. A later exception is portrayed when a Romulan cloaking device is installed on the USS Defiant under specified restrictions and oversight."

      "Summary": "A shipboard cloaking system used to conceal Klingon vessels—most iconically Birds-of-Prey—while they maneuver into position for attack or withdrawal. On screen, Klingon cloak tactics emphasize ambush: close while hidden, reveal briefly to strike, then disappear again.\n\nBaseline portrayals generally require a ship to decloak to fire, and opponents can sometimes reveal cloaked ships using specialized detection methods such as tachyon-based scans and grids. A notable exception is a prototype Bird‑of‑Prey depicted as firing torpedoes while remaining cloaked.",
      "Sections": {
        "Tactical pattern": "Klingon cloak use is typically staged as an ambush tool. Cloaked ships close to favorable range and angle, decloak to attack, and recloak to reposition or disengage.\n\nThis makes the cloak less about permanent invisibility and more about controlling engagement distance and timing.",
        "Platforms and deployment": "Cloaking is strongly associated with Klingon Birds-of-Prey across multiple eras, and it also appears on other Klingon vessels in various stories. Regardless of platform, the cloak is treated as integrated ship equipment rather than a one-off trick.",

In one film depiction, observers notice spatial distortions associated with a cloaked Bird-of-Prey.\n\nPrepared opponents also employ tachyon-based methods and detection grids to expose cloaked ships.",

      "Summary": "Deflector shields (often called simply “shields”) are ship-scale protective fields projected around a vessel or facility to reduce damage from weapons fire and environmental hazards. They are treated as a managed defensive resource: crews raise shields, redistribute strength, and adjust settings to keep critical areas covered as threat conditions change.\n\nShields are frequently shown being stressed, depleted, or bypassed, which drives tactical decisions—whether to hold position, withdraw to recover, or take risks with reduced coverage to preserve power for weapons, propulsion, or life support.",

        "What they do": "Shields form a defensive envelope that can absorb or deflect energy impacts and intercept physical debris. In practice they buy time—reducing immediate hull damage so a ship can maneuver, return fire, and repair other systems.",

      "Summary": "Transporters transfer people and material by converting matter to an energy pattern, transmitting it, and reconstructing it at the destination. They enable rapid ship‑to‑surface movement and emergency retrieval, but depend on stable targeting, clean environmental conditions, and high‑integrity pattern handling.",
      "Sections": {
        "Purpose & Use": "Transporters move people, cargo, and equipment between locations by converting matter to an energy pattern, transmitting it, and reassembling it at the destination. Starships use transporter rooms for routine transfers and also for rapid boarding, medical evacuation, and emergency retrieval when shuttles are impractical. Variants include personnel and cargo transporters, as well as point‑to‑point and site‑to‑site operations depending on the platform and situation.",
        "Transport Cycle": "A typical transport begins with a target acquisition and a coordinate lock, followed by a controlled dematerialization. The subject is carried as a contained matter stream within a confinement beam, then reconstructed by the receiving system. Operators monitor pattern integrity and timing, and can pause, redirect, or abort the cycle when conditions degrade. Because transport is a tightly timed sequence, interruptions can produce partial or unstable materialization.",
        "Pattern Storage": "Transporters can temporarily store a subject’s pattern in a buffer. This allows short holds during routing changes or recovery steps, and in exceptional circumstances a pattern can be sustained far longer than intended by deliberately keeping it in the buffer. Buffer management is one reason transporters are treated as controlled spaces: patterns are sensitive to corruption if storage, power stability, or timing falls out of tolerance.",
        "Targeting & Locks": "Successful transport depends on resolving the destination volume and maintaining a stable lock on the subject. Ships use sensors and transporter targeting to compensate for motion, distance, and local interference. In complex environments, crews may employ enhancers or other aids to strengthen acquisition and improve pattern resolution. When the lock is weak, transport becomes slower, less precise, or impossible.",
        "Safety Systems": "Transporters incorporate safeguards intended to prevent hazards from being carried aboard. Biofilters screen patterns during transfer, and systems can be configured for quarantine or containment procedures. Operators also watch for pattern anomalies and can rematerialize to a safe staging point or back to the origin when reconstruction is unsafe. Even with safeguards, transport can introduce risk when the subject’s pattern is altered or merged by unusual conditions.",
        "Operational Constraints": "Transport is limited by environmental and tactical factors. Active shields, dense interference, and certain atmospheric or subspace conditions can block or distort a beam. Extreme relative motion and rapidly changing geometry can break a lock. Power loss or emitter damage can interrupt the cycle at the worst moment, forcing emergency procedures and rapid troubleshooting to restore pattern integrity."

      "Type": "System",
      "Summary": "Tractor beams project controlled force to hold, tow, or stabilize objects in space. They support rescue, capture, debris recovery, and precision handling during docking by damping motion and maintaining alignment without physical contact.",
      "Sections": {
        "Purpose & Use": "A tractor beam is a projected force used to hold, pull, push, or stabilize objects in space. Starships employ tractor beams for towing, rescue, capture, station‑keeping near hazards, and precision handling during docking and recovery operations. The beam gives a ship controlled influence over another object’s position and motion without physical contact.",
        "Beam Control": "Tractor operations are tuned for the target’s mass, geometry, and relative motion. Crews can change power and focus to shift from a gentle stabilizing hold to a stronger pull, or to counter drift and rotation. Fine control is critical when handling fragile structures or when bringing a vessel to a docking interface where alignment tolerances are tight.",
        "Towing & Retrieval": "Towing is typically performed by maintaining a steady lock and matching velocity while applying gradual acceleration. Tractor beams can also be used to retrieve debris, escape pods, and small craft, or to keep a distressed ship from tumbling. When used in combination with thrusters and navigation, the beam can act as a controlled “tow line” for complex maneuvers.",
        "Docking Support": "Tractor beams often assist docking by stabilizing approach, reducing relative motion, and holding a ship in position while mechanical clamps or seals engage. In crowded bays or near large structures, the beam can compensate for limited maneuvering room. This role overlaps directly with docking collars and airlock systems that complete the physical and atmospheric connection.",
        "Constraints & Countermeasures": "Tractor performance is limited by distance, line‑of‑sight geometry, power availability, and the target’s ability to resist or evade. Strong maneuvering thrust, structural stress limits, or defensive systems can break a hold. Overpowering a tractor on a large or accelerating target can risk damaging the emitter or imposing unsafe stresses on the tractored object."

      "Type": "Facility",
      "Summary": "Shuttlebays and launch bays are ship facilities for operating small craft—launch, recovery, storage, and maintenance. They provide an option when transporters cannot be used, and rely on doors, containment fields, and guidance procedures to manage safe movement between the ship’s interior and open space.",
      "Sections": {
        "Purpose & Use": "Shuttlebays and launch bays are facilities for launching, receiving, storing, and servicing small craft. They support away missions, logistics, medical evacuation, and contingency operations when transporters are unavailable or inappropriate. Bays include traffic control procedures, ground handling, and maintenance infrastructure tailored to the ship class and mission profile.",
        "Access & Containment": "External access is controlled through bay doors, while internal pressure doors and field barriers manage atmosphere and safety. When operations require opening to space, force‑field containment can provide a working barrier so craft can enter or exit without venting the entire bay. Lighting, markings, and guidance systems aid approach and departure in limited visibility.",
        "Launch & Recovery": "Launch sequences coordinate bay clearance, door or field status, and craft power‑up. Recovery emphasizes controlled approach, speed limits, and final alignment to landing pads or docking points within the bay. In tight bays, tractor assistance or guidance beacons may be used to steady a craft during the last meters of motion.",
        "Maintenance & Support": "Bays serve as workshops and staging areas for refit, repair, and payload preparation. Equipment typically includes fueling and power interfaces, tooling, diagnostics, and storage for mission kits. Because shuttles are often exposed to hazards that the main ship avoids, bays must be able to contain damage, isolate contaminated craft, and support rapid turnaround.",
        "Operational Constraints": "Bay operations depend on ship attitude control, local traffic conditions, and the integrity of doors and containment fields. Damage to bay doors or power interruptions can force a halt to flight operations. Under combat or high‑risk conditions, crews may restrict launches to avoid exposing the ship’s interior or compromising hull integrity around the bay aperture."

      "Summary": "Docking systems secure ships and craft to stations or other vessels for safe transfer of people, cargo, and services. They combine precision alignment, mechanical securing hardware, and pressure‑managed interfaces such as docking ports and airlocks.",
      "Sections": {
        "Purpose & Use": "Docking systems secure a ship or craft to another vessel, station, or facility to transfer personnel, cargo, and services. They provide a controlled physical interface—aligning structures, sealing an opening, and managing atmosphere—so movement between hulls is safe and routine. Docking can be external (port‑to‑port) or internal (into a docking bay) depending on the design.",
        "Interfaces": "Common docking interfaces include hull docking ports and airlocks, as well as collars and ring structures sized for specific craft. Ports are designed for precise alignment so seals can engage without stressing the hull. An airlock or transfer tunnel provides a buffer zone for pressure equalization and prevents uncontrolled decompression during entry and exit.",
        "Approach & Alignment": "Docking begins with a controlled approach, relative‑motion matching, and a final alignment solution. Ships may use thrusters for fine positioning and tractor assistance when available. Guidance lights, beacons, and automated docking controls can reduce risk, but crews still treat the final meters as a high‑precision maneuver because even a small misalignment can prevent seal engagement.",
        "Securing & Seals": "Once aligned, docking clamps or latches secure the two structures so they can’t drift apart under thrust or station‑keeping loads. A pressure seal then engages to hold atmosphere across the interface. Systems monitor seal integrity and can isolate the connection if pressure drops or the structure is compromised, preventing a localized breach from propagating into the ship.",
        "Transfer & Services": "With a secure seal, docking supports movement of people and cargo and can also provide service connections—power, data, life support, and refueling—depending on the facility. Internal bay docking adds another layer of safety by keeping operations within a controlled volume, while external docking prioritizes direct access and rapid turnaround.",
        "Operational Constraints": "Docking depends on compatible geometry and a stable platform. High relative velocity, turbulence, or combat damage can prevent safe engagement. In emergencies, systems must support rapid separation, including manual releases or emergency clamp procedures. The interface is also a vulnerability: a compromised seal or structural failure can force immediate isolation and evacuation of the docked area."
